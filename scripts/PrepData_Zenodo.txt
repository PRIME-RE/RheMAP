1) you paste both scripts into the directory which contains the structure you want to flatten
--> careful: all files in this directory will be added to the tree.json file and added to the `flat` directory which will be created â€“ so only have files there you are happy to share :)  
2) run source flatten.sh
3) duplicate flat directory
4) cd flat --> run source unflatten.sh
5) rm flatten.sh, unflatten.sh, and tree.json, rename this directory to all_the_data, and zip all_the_data using zip -r -X all_the_data.zip all_the_data
6) rename the duplicate flat directory back to flat
7) upload all the content of flat using script (because zenodo interface only works for files of a certain minimum files sizes and it failed for me for meta data json files. but if it works for you for all files you can use interface)
8) upload zip directory (interface drag and drop)
